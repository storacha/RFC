## Abstract

Formalizes a process of migrating the [Filecoin Saturn](https://github.com/filecoin-saturn), [NFT.Storage](https://github.com/nftstorage), and [Web3 Storage](https://github.com/web3-storage) orgs into [w3s](https://github.com/w3s-project).

Goals:
- To achieve cost-savings across orgs by only billing a single one;
- To minimize maintenance complexity by consolidating the list of org repos we want to take on;
- To ensure a common understanding on how repositories should be migrated on a case-by-case basis;
- To ensure all repo-dependant systems continue operating transparently;
    - i.e. to provide recommendations/fixes to make the migration process as smooth and bulletproof as possible;
    - If such a goal is not possible, then the secondary goal is to provide the necessary changes to either prevent the system from stopping its operation or to recover it.
- To keep project tracking as simple as possible.
    - i.e. across a single org.

## Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119).

Source orgs: [Filecoin Saturn](https://github.com/filecoin-saturn), [NFT.Storage](https://github.com/nftstorage), [Web3 Storage](https://github.com/web3-storage).
Final org: [w3s](https://github.com/w3s-project).

Migration is defined as either:
- transferring repo ownership from a source org into the final org;
- forking a source repo in the source org into the final org.

Local Migration is defined as the act of moving a repo into the post-migration filesystem path while ensuring its [Git remote](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-remote) matches a path in the final org.

## Out of scope

- Tidying up local Git state post-migration (i.e. removing old remotes, and branches);
- Defining a standard method to authenticate with Github;
- Settling on a specific Github billing plan;

## Migration consequences and Failure scenarios

According to [Transferring a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/transferring-a-repository): 

> "When you transfer a repository, its issues, pull requests, wiki, stars, and watchers are also transferred. If the transferred repository contains webhooks, services, secrets, or deploy keys, they will remain associated after the transfer is complete. Git information about commits, including contributions, is preserved.".
> (...)
> "All links to the previous repository location are automatically redirected to the new location. When you use git clone, git fetch, or git push on a transferred repository, these commands will redirect to the new repository location or URL. However, to avoid confusion, we strongly recommend updating any existing local clones to point to the new repository URL."

This ensures migration disruptions are minimal and that we can keep operating normally and migrate on a repo-by-repo basis. Still, it is crucial to look at each repo individually to ascertain migration consequences which may impact other systems outside of Github and our local development machines.
Additionally, it is RECOMMENDED to perform the [post-migration instructions](#post-migration-instructions) below.

CI pipelines were checked to make sure nothing relies on a particular repo naming structure. Github was used and the results were manually checked using the following search commands:

  - `org:filecoin-saturn AND ("git@github.com" OR "https://github.com" OR "https://raw.githubusercontent.com") AND (path:*.yaml OR path:*.yml)`
  - `org:web3-storage  AND ("git@github.com" OR "https://github.com" OR "https://raw.githubusercontent.com") AND (path:*.yaml OR path:*.yml)`

## Repository Migration Overview

New repositories MUST be created in [w3s](https://github.com/w3s-project).

The goal of this section is to migrate repos we are going to be actively working on, so we're able to downgrade source orgs to the Github free tier.
Ideally, migrations should happen when we are working on repos whose purpose overlaps between w3s and the previous project.

We have a total of 203 repositories, 193 are migration candidates, 10 are already archived.
We SHOULD migrate repos one-by-one with an opportunistic approach after we have established it is safe to do so.
A repository with `[ ]` has pending actions to execute.
If a given repository has no checkbox, than means it was archived prior to this document.

The following repos lists were computed with: `curl -Ls -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" -H "Authorization: Bearer $GITHUB_TOKEN" -H "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28" https://api.github.com/orgs/$ORG/repos\?per_page\=100\&page\=$PAGE | jq -r '.[] | select(.archived|not) | "- [ ] [" + .name + "](" + .html_url + ")"'`, where `$ORG ∈ {"web3-storage", "nftstorage", "filecoin-saturn"}`, `GITHUB_TOKEN` is a token with access to all orgs, and `$PAGE ∈ [1,2]`. Further reference [here](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/repos/repos?apiVersion=2022-11-28#list-organization-repositories).

### [Filecoin Saturn](https://github.com/filecoin-saturn)

## Post-migration instructions

### Local Migration

The goal of this section is to provide a concise and simple way to operate on a given repo post-migration without losing any local changes. 
This is provided in the form of shell commands (more specifically using `bash` and [GNU findutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/findutils)).

Exact repo path are provided as examples and may not result in a precise command for everyone. To account for this, `$PATH_PREFIX` should equal the path prefix that is required to reach a given repo from your current directory. For instance, while writing this, this means `PATH_PREFIX=~/ghq/github.com`.

A given `ORG` is assumed to exist in the one's filesystem beforehand. If not a [git clone](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone) targeting `https://github.com/w3s-project/$REPO` is RECOMMENDED (see the [Repository Overview](#repository-migration-overview) for specific values for `REPO`).

#### Partial org migration

In this scenario, one is attempting to do a local migration on a single or set of repos.
We assume your Git remote is called `origin`.

1. Check your remote for the repo to make sure you're not missing anything: `git -C $REPO remote -v`;
2. Set the remote to the final org: `git -C "$PATH_REFIX/$ORG/$REPO" remote set-url origin "git@github.com:w3s-project/$REPO"`.

#### Full org migration

**Note: Run with caution, as this section is being validated**

In this scenario, one is attempting to do a local migration on all local repos for a particular `ORG`.
We assume your Git remote is called `origin` and that ssh authentication is the desired method (if you want to switch authentication look [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/managing-remote-repositories#switching-remote-urls-from-https-to-ssh)).

1. Check your remotes for all repos within an `ORG` to make sure you're not missing anything: `find "$PATH_PREFIX/$ORG" -maxdepth 1 -type d ! -path "$PATH_PREFIX/$ORG" | xargs -pI{} git -C {} remote -v`;
2. Move the `ORG` into its new filesystem path: `mv "$PATH_PREFIX/$ORG" "$PATH_PREFIX/w3s-project"`;
3. Set remotes to the final org: `find "$PATH_PREFIX/$ORG" -maxdepth 1 -type d ! -path "$PATH_PREFIX/$ORG" | xargs -pI{} sh -c 'repo="$(basename {})"; git -C {} remote set-url origin "git@github.com:w3s-project/$repo"'`.
