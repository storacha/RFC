## Abstract

In the context of team communication, a "async first" team methodology prioritizes asynchronous modes of communication over synchronous ones to enhance collaboration efficiency and flexibility within software development teams. 

We formalize in this RFC the process for a thriving collaboration on the w3s team.

## Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119).

## Team Background

The w3s team comprises individuals who have played integral roles in the development of web3.storage and Filecoin Saturn, both initiatives deeply rooted within Protocol Labs. As an organization, Protocol Labs has embraced asynchronous communication since its inception, with half of our team boasting extensive tenures exceeding 5 years.

With 12 members, our team predominantly consists of seasoned professionals with extensive expertise. Our team culture prioritizes shipping fast and iteratively without compromising quality, driven by a foundation of well-formulated proposals and a commitment to iterative feedback, discussions, and detailed specifications throughout the implementation process.

Operating numerous services, our team is dispersed across multiple countries, leading to potential timezone variances of up to 10 hours. This global presence fosters around-the-clock productivity and a diverse perspective within our collaborative endeavors."

## Async vs sync teams

We recognize that each methodology offers its own set of advantages and drawbacks. Various teams may excel under different methodologies, influenced by factors such as team seniority, physical proximity, time zone disparities, and individual preferences.

### Advantages of Async Team Communication

1. Flexibility: Async communication allows team members to engage with work-related discussions and tasks at their convenience, accommodating diverse schedules and time zones.
2. Reduced Interruptions: By minimizing synchronous meetings and real-time communication channels, async methodologies help mitigate interruptions, allowing individuals to focus on deep work and productivity.
3. Increased Thoughtfulness: With async communication, individuals have more time to reflect on their responses and contributions, leading to more considered and well-articulated ideas. Moreover, by allowing participants to engage at their own pace and reducing the pressure of immediate responses, async methodologies create a more supportive environment where individuals with challenges such as social anxiety can contribute comfortably and constructively to team discussions.
4. Documentation: Asynchronous communication encourages the documentation of discussions and decisions, fostering transparency and ensuring that information is accessible to all team members, as well as a ramp up for new members joining the team.
5. Expanded Hiring Opportunities: Embracing async communication widens the talent pool by accommodating individuals from diverse backgrounds and geographic locations. This inclusivity fosters a richer variety of perspectives, experiences, and skills within the team, ultimately enhancing innovation and problem-solving capabilities.
6. Streamlined Onboarding Process: Async communication promotes thorough documentation of discussions, decisions, and project information, providing valuable resources for new team members during the onboarding process. This accessibility to historical context and archived conversations facilitates a smoother transition and accelerates the integration of newcomers into the team.
7. Mitigated Knowledge Loss: With comprehensive documentation and asynchronous communication norms in place, the risk of losing critical knowledge during employee offboarding is significantly reduced. Team members can easily access archived information and refer to previous discussions, ensuring continuity of work and minimizing disruptions caused by personnel changes.

### Disadvantages of Async Team Communication

1. Delayed Responses: Asynchronous communication may lead to delays in receiving responses or feedback, potentially slowing down decision-making processes and project progress.
2. Lack of Real-Time Collaboration: Unlike synchronous methods, async communication may not facilitate immediate collaboration or brainstorming sessions, which could hinder rapid problem-solving or decision-making.
3. Miscommunication Risks: Without real-time interaction, there is a higher risk of misinterpretation or misunderstanding of messages, particularly in complex or nuanced discussions.
4. Coordination Challenges: Coordinating tasks and resolving conflicts may require more effort and time in an async communication environment compared to synchronous methods.

## Async first team process proposed

Our team's characteristics naturally lend themselves to asynchronous communication, yet we recognize the value of synchronous interactions in certain contexts. Synchronous communication becomes particularly beneficial when expediting decision-making, clarifying objectives, and involving a small set of individuals. It's also important to maintain a sense of enjoyment and proportional connections within the team.

We advocate for initiating asynchronous processes, which may culminate in synchronous sessions to reach consensus among team members, starting with a proposal. Following one or more rounds of asynchronous feedback and discussion, a subset of the team CAN be involved on a highly productive synchronous session to align on specific set of items.

For fast final alignments and swift decision-making, it's essential to involve a small subset of the team in high-bandwidth one-on-one or small group synchronous discussions, prioritizing efficiency and flexibility.

Considering the small intersection window of some members of the team, spontaneous synchronous discussions should be encouraged and recognized as they naturally occur, rather than relying solely on scheduled calendar slots that may hinder important conversations. While these spontaneous discussions MAY not always align immediately, it's advisable to plan them with some lead time before critical decisions need to be made.

For sprint planning and ensuring everyone grasps the broader picture, a recurring weekly synchronous meeting may be suggested as a best practice. These meetings should be recorded, have a predefined agenda, and clearly outlined objectives from the outset.

Whether recurring or impromptu, outcomes from meetings such as recordings, notes, or summaries should be shared with the broader team to ensure transparency and alignment.

## Tips to thrive in such environment

1. Continuously anticipate potential blockers or issues and communicate them proactively via asynchronous channels with the team before they impede progress.
2. If you encounter a blockage, promptly notify the team through asynchronous communication and identify individuals who MAY offer assistance.
3. For design work/team process changes, initiate the process with an asynchronous proposal by one or more team members. Subsequently, gather asynchronous feedback rounds to address simpler aspects.
4. Prior to scheduling a meeting, ensure that all relevant materials have been shared in advance to allow the team to review and provide initial asynchronous feedback. This optimizes synchronous meeting time for aligning on complex issues rather than rehashing previously discussed topics.
5. Capture synchronous meeting discussions through documentation, recording, and cataloging in a manner accessible to all team members without the need for inquiry.
6. Consistently document decisions to enable future team members to easily understand the rationale behind each choice.
